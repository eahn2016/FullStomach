# FullStomach
A short GBA platformer game

"I Died on a Full Stomach" is a short platformer game that I created for the Game Boy. It has two short levels, which includes fully original pixelart, and ends with a boss fight.

You are a ghost who is in need of a toilet. In order to reach the toilet, you must go through the underworld's challenges and weave through many devils who attempt to thwart your journey, while collecting toilet paper. You are able to poop on top of the heads of devils in order to kill them. The final boss is a Bunny King. You must solve the mini puzzle in order to defeat this boss.
